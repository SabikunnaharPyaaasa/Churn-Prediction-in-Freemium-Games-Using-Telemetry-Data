🎮 Churn Prediction in Freemium Games Using Telemetry Data

This project predicts player churn in freemium mobile games using telemetry data collected over a short observation period. By analyzing in-game behavior and activity patterns, we use machine learning models to classify whether a player is likely to stop playing in the near future.
